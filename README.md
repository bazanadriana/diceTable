# 🎲 diceTable — Fair Dice Roll Game with HMAC

This is a command-line dice game written in Node.js that ensures fairness using HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code).

Each round consists of:
- Secret key generation
- HMAC commitment before choices are revealed
- Final reveal with key and values for verification

## 🔐 Fairness Using HMAC

HMAC proves that the computer cannot change its choice after seeing the user's choice. Here's how:
1. A random number is selected by the computer.
2. A secure key is generated using `crypto.randomBytes`.
3. The HMAC is calculated from the number + key and shown to the user.
4. After the user's move, the computer reveals the number and key.
5. Anyone can verify the original HMAC using the revealed key + message.

## 🎮 How It Works

- Both players (user and computer) choose a die from 3 custom dice.
- Each die has different value distributions to encourage strategy.
- Players then roll using values generated by combining two rounds of randomness.
- The winner is the one with the higher rolled value.
